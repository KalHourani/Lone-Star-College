#Reverse Array

Write a function that accepts an int array and the arrayâ€™s size as arguments. The function should create a copy of the array, except that the element values should be reversed in the copy. The function should return a pointer to the newarray. Demonstrate the function by using it in a main program that reads an integer <b><i>N</i></b> (that is not more than 50) from standard input and then reads <b><i>N</i></b> integers from a file named <b><i>data</i></b> into an array. The program then passes the array to the your reverse array function, and prints the values of the new reversed array on standard output, one value per line. You may assume that the file <b><i>data</i></b> has at least <b><i>N</i></b> values .

<b>Prompts And Output Labels.</b> There are no prompts for the integer and no labels for the reversed array that is printed out.

<b>Input Validation.</b> If the integer read in from standard input exceeds 50 or is less than 0 the program terminates silently.
