#Problem Description

Reverse Array

Write a function that accepts an int  array  and the array â€™s size as arguments . The function should create a copy of the array , except that the element  values  should be reversed in the copy. The function should return a pointer to the newarray . Demonstrate the function by using it in a main program  that reads an integer  N  (that is not more than 50) from standard input and then reads N  integers  from a file named  data  into an array . The program  then passes thearray  to the your reverse array  function, and prints the values  of the new reversed array  on standard output , one value  per line. You may assume  that the file data  has at least N  values .

Prompts And Output  Labels. There are no prompts for the integer  and no labels for the reversed array  that is printed out.

Input Validation. If the integer  read in from standard input exceeds 50 or is less than  0 the program  terminates silently.
