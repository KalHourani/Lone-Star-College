#Circle Class 

Write a Circle class  that has the following member variables:

* radius: a double 
* pi: a double  initialized  with the value  3.14159

The class  should have the following member functions:

* Default Constructor . A default constructor  that sets radius to 0.0.
* Constructor . Accepts the radius of the circle as an argument .
* setRadius. A mutator function for the radius variable .
* getRadius. An accessor function for the radius variable .
* getArea. Returns the area of the circle, which is calculated as area = pi * radius * radius
* getDiameter. Returns the diameter of the circle, which is calculated as diameter = radius * 2
* getCircumference. Returns the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as circumference = 2 * pi * radius

Write a program  that demonstrates the Circle class  by asking the user for the circle’s radius, creating a Circle object , and then reporting the circle’s area, diameter, and circumference.

Sample Run:

Calling defeault constructor: The circle's radius in the default Circle Object is: 0

 Calling setRadius(20) to change radius of default:

The circle's radius in the default Circle Object is Now: 20

 Creating Circle circle2(10):

The circle2's radius in the circle2 Object is: 10

 The circle2's area is therefore: 314.159

The circle2's diameter is therefore: 20

The circle2's circumference is therefore: 62.8318
