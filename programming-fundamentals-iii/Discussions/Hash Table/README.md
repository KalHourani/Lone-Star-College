# Hash Table

A hash table of size M stores N integer keys. Collisions are handled by chaining and the hash function is h(K)=K mod M.

1. What is the worst-case search time? Give an example of a set of keys that achieves the worst-case search time.
2. Would you use this hash table for a time-critical application (e.g., airtraï¬ƒc control)
